                                   SECTION 1
                                   ---------

                          USE OF THE LEASED PREMISES
                          --------------------------

     (a) Lessor, in consideration of the rents to be paid and covenants herein
contained, hereby leases to Lessee the Leased Premises.

     (b) Lessee may use the Leased Premises for the operation of its radio
station, and, in connection therewith, for the installation, repair,
maintenance, operation, housing and removal of its Improvements and other

exclusively for purposes associated with the operation of a radio station.

     (c) Lessee shall have the right from time to time to substitute
Installations of similar kind and character for those hereinabove specified,
provided such changes shall be approved in advance by Lessor, and Lessor shall
not unreasonably delay or withhold its approval. In the event Lessee submits any
such changes for Lessor's approval and Lessor does not respond within
 
thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt thereof, then such changes shall be
deemed approved by Lessor, so long as such changes otherwise comply with this
Agreement, five (5) days after Lessor's receipt of notice that it has not
responded.

     (d) Lessee shall have access to the Leased Premises twenty-four (24) hours
per day, seven (7) days per week, for the purpose of installing, maintaining and
repairing its Installations, provided that the contractors performing such work
are reasonably acceptable to Lessor.

     (e) Lessor shall not be responsible for repairs or maintenance to the
Installations, except for repairs occasioned by the negligence of Lessor, its
agents, employees or contractors.

     (f) During the Term (as hereinafter defined), Lessor and Lessee shall each
provide the other with a telephone number which, if called will ring at a
location that is staffed by their respective agents twenty-four (24) hours each
and every day, seven (7) days each and every week; and Lessor and Lessee shall
notify each other promptly in the event of any change in such telephone number.

     (g) Lessee shall not use or permit the Leased Premises to be used by any
dangerous, toxic, noxious or offensive trade or business, or for any unlawful
purpose.

     (h) Lessee shall not directly or indirectly create or permit to be created
or to remain, and will discharge any mortgage, lien, security interest,
encumbrance or charge on, pledge of or conditional sale or other title retention
agreement with respect to the Real Property or any part thereof or Lessee's
interest therein other than (i) this Agreement, (ii) any lien, including a
mortgage on the leasehold interest of Lessee, which may be approved by the
Lessor in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, (iii)
liens for impositions not yet payable, or payable without the addition of any
fine, penalty, interest or cost for non-payment, or being contested as permitted
by Paragraph 3(d), below, and (iv) liens of mechanics, materialmen, suppliers or
vendors, or rights thereto, incurred in the ordinary course of business for sums
which under the terms of the related contracts are not at the time due, provided
that adequate provision for the payment thereof shall have been made.

                                   SECTION 2
                                   ---------

                                 TERM AND RENT
                                 -------------

     (a) The term of this Lease (the "Term") shall commence on February 1, 1997
(the "Commencement Date"), and shall expire on January 31, 1998 (the "Expiration
Date"). If the Term has been extended as provided in subparagraph (b), below,
the Expiration Date shall be the last day of the Term as so extended.
 
     (b) Lessee shall have the option, if Lessee is not at the time in default
under this Agreement, to extend the Term of this Agreement for up to two (2)
successive periods of five (5) years each (the "Extended Terms"), and, except as
set forth in subparagraph (c), below, on the same terms, covenants and
conditions herein contained. The word "Term" as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include the Extended Terms when and if the Agreement is extended. Each
option to extend the Term shall be exercised only by Lessee's delivery to Lessor
by United States mail on or before ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of
the renewal term of written notice of Lessee's election to extend as provided
herein.

     (c) Lessee agrees to pay rent to Lessor from the Commencement Date through
the Expiration Date, or such earlier date as this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein, at 4880 Santa Rosa Road, Suite 300, Camarillo, CA 93012, Attn:
Accounting, or to such other person or place as Lessor may designate from time
to time by notice to Lessee, in the following amounts and in the following
manner:

           (i)  During the first year beginning with the Commencement Date
Lessee shall pay a base rent of $33,600 per annum, in equal monthly installments
of $2,800 (the "Base Rent") in advance on the first day of each month; and
thereafter on each and every Adjustment Date (hereinafter defined) the monthly
rent shall be computed according to subparagraph (ii) below.

           (ii) The term "Adjustment Date" shall mean the first (1st)
anniversary of the Commencement Date and each subsequent anniversary of the
Commencement Date this Agreement remains in effect. During the one (1) year
period beginning with each Adjustment Date, the monthly rent payable by Lessee
shall reflect an adjustment, as herein provided, for the change, if any, from
the year in which the Commencement Date falls, in the Consumer Price Index for
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, Los Angeles area [Base Year 1982-
84=100] ("CPI") as measured in February and published by the United States
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; i.e., during the one (1) year
period beginning with the Adjustment Date, the monthly rent shall be the product
obtained by multiplying the Base Rent times a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the CPI for February of the year such Adjustment Date falls and the
denominator of which shall be the CPI for February of the year in which the
Commencement Date falls. Notwithstanding the results of the foregoing
calculation, the amount payable by Lessee hereunder shall not in any event be
less than the rental paid during the immediately preceding one (1) year period
and the annual adjustment, as set forth in this Section 4.3, shall not exceed
                                                -----------
five percent (5%) of the rental paid in the preceding one (1) year period. In
the event that the Bureau of Labor Statistics shall change the base period for
the CPI, the new index number shall be substituted for the old index number in
making the above computation. In the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics ceases
publishing the CPI, or materially changes the method of its computation, Lessor
and Lessee shall accept comparable statistics on the purchasing power of the
consumer dollar as published at the time of said discontinuation or change by a
responsible financial periodical of recognized authority to be chosen by Lessor
subject to reasonable consent of Lessee.

     (d) Rent and all other sums payable to Lessor hereunder shall be paid
without notice, demand, counterclaim, set-off, deduction or defense and without
abatement, suspension,
 
deferment, diminution or reduction. Except as expressly provided herein, Lessee
waives all rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise to quit,
terminate or surrender this Agreement or the Real Property or any part thereof,
or to any abatement, suspension, deferment, diminution or reduction of rent or
any other sum payable by Lessee hereunder.

                                   SECTION 3
                                   ---------

                             CHARGES AND UTILITIES
                             ---------------------

        (a) Lessee, at its sole expense, shall keep the Real Property and the
adjoining streets and ways in good and clean order and condition and will
promptly make all necessary or appropriate repairs, replacements and renewals
thereof, whether interior or exterior, structural or non-structural, ordinary or
extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen. All repairs, replacements and renewals
shall be equal in quality and class to the original work. Lessee waives any
right created by any law now or hereafter in force to make repairs to the Real
Property at Lessor's expense. Lessee, at its sole expense, shall do or cause
others to do every act necessary or appropriate for the preservation and safety
of the Real Property whether or not the Lessor shall be required by any legal
requirement to take such action or be liable for failure to do so.

        (b) If not at the time in default under this Agreement, Lessee, at its
sole expense, may make reasonable alterations of and additions to the
Improvements or any part thereof, provided that any alteration or addition (i)
shall not change the general character of the Improvements, or reduce the fair
market value thereof below their value immediately before such alteration or
addition, or impair their usefulness, (ii) is effected with due diligence, in a
good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all legal requirements and
insurance requirements, (iii) is promptly and fully paid for by Lessee, (iv) is
made, in case the estimated cost of such alteration or addition exceeds Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000), under the supervision of an architect or engineer
satisfactory to Lessor and in accordance with plans, specifications and cost
estimates approved by Lessor, and (v) does not interfere with Lessor's rights of
use under this Agreement.

        (c) Subject to subparagraph (d), below, relating to contests, Lessee
shall pay all taxes, assessments (including without limitation, all assessments
for public improvements or benefits, whether or not commenced or completed prior
to the date hereof and whether or not to be completed within the Term hereof),
ground rents, water, sewer or similar rents, rates and charges, excises, levies,
license fees, permit fees, inspection fees and other authorization fees and
other charges in each case, whether general or special, ordinary or

any estate, right or interest therein, or any occupancy, use or possession of or
activity conducted on the Real Property or any part thereof, other than any
income or excess profits tax imposed upon the Lessor's general income or
revenues, but excluding any income or excess profits or franchise taxes of
Lessor determined on the basis of general income or revenue or any interest or
penalties in respect thereof. Lessee shall furnish to Lessor for inspection
within thirty (30) days after written request, official receipts of the
appropriate taxing authority or other proof satisfactory to
 
Lessor evidencing such payment. If by law any such amount may be paid in
installments, Lessee shall be obligated to pay only those installments as they
become due from time to time before any interest, penalty, fine or cost may be
added thereto; and any such amount relating to the fiscal period of the taxing
authority, part of which is included within the Term and a part of which extends
beyond the Term shall, if Lessee shall not be in default under this Agreement,

to Lessor, by appropriate legal proceedings conducted in good faith and with due
diligence, the amount or validity or application, in whole or in part, of any
tax, lien or other imposition on the Real Property, provided that (i) Lessee
shall first make all contested payments, under protest if it desires, (ii)
neither the Real Property nor any part thereof or interest therein nor any such
rents or other sums would be in any danger of being sold, forfeited, lost or
interfered with, and (iii) Lessee shall have furnished such security, if any, as

                                   SECTION 4
                                   ---------

                         INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION
                         -----------------------------

     (a)   Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense, during the Term hereof,
obtain or provide and keep in full force for the benefit of Lessor, as an
additional named insured (i) general public liability insurance, insuring Lessor
against any and all liability or claims or liability arising out of, occasioned
by or resulting from any accident or other occurrence in or about the Real
Property arising out of any act or omission of Lessee or any officer, employee,
agent or contractor of Lessee, for injuries to any person or persons, with
limits of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) for injuries to
one person, Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for injuries to more than one

time included under "extended coverage" policies, in an amount equal to at least
One Hundred Percent (100%) of the full replacement value of the Improvements
and, in any event, in an amount sufficient to prevent Lessor or Lessee from
becoming a co-insurer of any partial loss under the applicable policies, which
shall be written on a replacement cost basis; (iii) appropriate workers'
compensation or other insurance against liability arising from claims of workers
in respect of and during the period of any work on or about the Real Property;
and (iv) insurance against such other hazards and in such amounts as is
customarily carried by owners and operators of similar properties, and as Lessor
may reasonably require for its protection. Lessee shall comply with such other
requirements as Lessor, or any mortgagee, may from time to
 
time reasonably request for the protection by insurance of their respective
interests. The policy or policies of insurance maintained by Lessee pursuant to
this Paragraph shall be of a company or companies authorized to do business in
California and a certificate thereof shall be delivered to Lessor, together with
evidence of the payment of the premiums therefor, not less than fifteen (15)
days prior to the commencement of the Term hereof or of the date when Lessee
shall enter upon the Leased Premises, whichever occurs sooner. At least fifteen
(15) days prior to the expiration or termination date of any policy, Lessee
shall deliver a certificate of a renewal or replacement policy with proof of the
payment of the premium therefor. Any such insurance required by this Paragraph
may, at Lessee's option, be provided through a blanket policy or policies.

     (b)   Lessee shall indemnify Lessor and hold Lessor harmless from and
against all claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by or asserted against Lessor,
whether during or after the Term of this Agreement, including by reason of
personal injury, loss of life, or damage to property, caused by or resulting
from in whole or any material part, (i) any breach of this Agreement by Lessee,
(ii) any negligent or intentional act or omission of Lessee, its employees,
agents, invitees or contractors, whether in, on, about or with respect to the
Leased Premises or otherwise, (iii) the use by Lessee of any part of the Leased
Premises, (iv) any work undertaken by or at the request of Lessee on or about
the Leased Premises, (v) any other activity undertaken by or at the request of
Lessee pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, or (vi) the presence of
any individuals on the Leased Premises as a result of Lessee's request or this
Agreement; provided, however, that Lessee shall not be required to indemnify
Lessor for any damages, injury, loss or expense arising out of Lessor's or its
agents', employees', invitees' or contractors' negligent acts or omissions.

     (c)   If Lessor so elects by notice to Lessee, Lessee shall have the
obligation of defending, at its sole cost and expense, by counsel selected by
Lessee and approved by Lessor (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld),
against any claim to which the foregoing indemnity may apply. Lessor may assume,
or require that such defense be assumed, by Lessor and counsel selected by
Lessor, at the cost and expense of Lessee if Lessor is for any reason
dissatisfied with the defense by Lessee, or believes that its interests would be
better served thereby. In any case where Lessee is defending any such claim,
Lessor may participate in the defense thereof by counsel selected by it, but at
Lessor's expense. Lessee shall not enter into any settlement of any claim
without the consent of Lessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (d)   Lessor shall indemnify Lessee and hold Lessee harmless from and
against all claims, actions, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by or asserted against Lessee,
whether during or after the Term of this Agreement, including by reason of
personal injury, loss of life, or damage to property, caused by or resulting
from in whole or any material part, (i) any breach of this Agreement by Lessor,
(ii) any negligent or intentional act or omission of Lessor, its employees,
agents, invitees or contractors, whether in, on, about or with respect to the
Leased Premises or otherwise, (iii) the use by Lessor of any part of the Leased
Premises, (iv) any work undertaken by or at the request of Lessor on or about
the Leased Premises, (v) any other activity undertaken by or at the request of
Lessor pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, or (vi) the presence of
any individuals on the Leased Premises as a result of Lessor's request or this
Agreement; provided, however, that Lessor shall not be
 
required to indemnify Lessee for any damages, injury, loss or expense arising
out of Lessee's or its agents', employees', invitees' or contractors' negligent
acts or omissions.

     (e)   If Lessee so elects by notice to Lessor, Lessor shall have the
obligation of defending, at its sole cost and expense, by counsel selected by
Lessor and approved by Lessee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld),
against any claim to which the foregoing indemnity may apply. Lessee may assume,
or require that such defense be assumed, by Lessee and counsel selected by
Lessee, at the cost and expense of Lessor if Lessee is for any reason
dissatisfied with the defense by Lessor, or believes that its interests would be
better served thereby. In any case where Lessor is defending any such claim,
Lessee may participate in the defense thereof by counsel selected by it, but at
Lessee's expense. Lessor shall not enter into any settlement of any claim
without the consent of Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (f)   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to authorize or
permit any insurer of Lessor or Lessee to be subrogated to any right of Lessor
or Lessee against the other. Each of Lessor and Lessee hereby releases the other
to the extent of its insurance coverage for any loss or damage caused by fire or
any of the extended coverage casualties, even if such fire or other casualty
shall be brought about by the fault or negligence of the other party or persons
for whose acts said party is liable.
